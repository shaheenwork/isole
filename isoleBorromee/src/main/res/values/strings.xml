	<!--<string name="isole_bela_desc"><![CDATA[The Isola Bella of the Borromeo Gulf is a real place but it feels like a dream.  Before our eyes stretches a grand baroque vision, a spectacular theatre of buildings and gardens rising from the waters and surrounded by mountains.  What was once a bare rock outcrop, home to a handful of fishermen, was transformed between the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries into one of the most delightful places in the whole of Italy.   The princely Palace of the Borromeo is built on the Northern part of the Island, and houses exceptionally significant furniture and artworks.  Alcoves and ballrooms, galleries of paintings and collections of tapestries, closets and grottoes alternates in a thrilling tour dense with exciting surprises.<br/>The visit continues through the Italianate Gardens, which have remained intact and unique worldwide for their extremely peculiar shape: a pyramid of  ten terraces raising above the lake, peopled with statues, obelisks, fountains, nymphs, espaliers of flowers and citrous fruit trees.  During the Romantic age new plants and new essences, new flowers and new conservatories were added to the previous ones.  And finally the last arrival, the true lords of the gardens: the white peacocks of the Borromeo.]]></string>

	<string name="isole_madre_desc"><![CDATA[This was the first of the Islands of the Borromean Archipelago to be inhabited by the noble Milanese family in the XVI century, and to this it owes its name of “Isola Madre”, the "Mother Island". The severe palace facing towards the Stresa shore of the lake, built under the direction of Pellegrino Tibaldi, famous Sixteenth Century architect and painter, active at the time of Cardinal Carlo Borromeo and King Philip II of Spain.  Visiting the palace is like plunging into the past, because the decor that embellishes the rooms mainly dates back to the first years of the Seventeenth Century.<br/>Once there were on the island coeval Italianate gardens, with terraces and plenty of fruit trees. Nowadays the green areas of Isola Madre are an admirable example of romantic English garden, with blocks of greenery which suddenly open to the surrounding landscape and offer spectacular blooms throughout the Spring and Summer months.  However the garden of Isola Madre is also full of life: innumerable ornamental birds live serene and undisturbed on the lawns and clearings of the park.]]></string>
	<string name="rocca_d_angera_desc"><![CDATA[The Angera Fortress is a perfectly and entirely well preserved Medieval fortress. It was built by the Visconti family in an impressive strategic spot on top of a cliff which looks down onto the Southernmost part of Lake Maggiore.  The Visconti family had the interior painted with a very important series of frescoes narrating the story of the decisive victory of the Visconti on the rival family of Torriani in 1277, which led to the command of the family over the town of Milan.<br/>In the Fifteenth Century the Angera Fortress passed into the hands of the Borromeo family, who kept it intact and unchanged until our days, enriching its interiors with precious furniture and unique collections, as the rich collection of historical dolls and toys.<br/>A Medieval Garden has recently been built around the Fortress. In a secluded and enchanted place which faithfully copies the shapes and uses of Medieval gardens, which were mainly intended for production. For this reason there are "verzieri" (vegetable gardens) of fruit and vegetables, gardens of medicinal herbs and flowers (reserved to the people living in the castle). At the end stretch the groves which separated the gardens from the lawns where the livestock used to pasture.]]></string>
